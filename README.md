**Hangman OOP in C++**
Experience Hangman, a polished and object‐oriented C++ implementation of the classic word puzzle. In this game, every guess is critical as you strive to save a man from the gallows. Select from categories—Months, Fruits, or Animals—and choose either an Easy or Hard difficulty level. A secret word is randomly chosen, and you must reveal it one letter at a time within limited attempts. Built with modern C++ OOP principles, this project showcases robust design, maintainability, and clean coding practices. Sharpen your mind, challenge your skills, and enjoy a truly engaging experience!
